- Github Actions is a CI/CD Tool
- We use Workflow to setup our CI/CD 
- Workflow:
    - Is an automated procedure
    - Made up of 1+ jobs
    - Triggered by events, scheduled events or manually
    - To setup, add a .yaml file inside .github/workflows
- We need a Runner for each job in a workflow
- Runner:
    - Is a server to run the jobs
    - Runs 1 job at a time 
    - Github hosted or self hosted 
    - Reports progress, logs and results to Github 
    - yaml file keyword: "runs-on"
- Job:
    - set of steps that execute on the same runner 
    - normal jobs run in parallel 
    - dependent jobs run serially
- Step:
    - Is an individual task 
    - Runs serially within a job 
    - Contains 1+ actions 
- Action:
    - is a standalone cmd 
    - runs serially within a step 
    - can be reused
